# **Car Evulation KNN of Machine Learning Software**
I developed machine learning software that evaluates vehicles against certain conditions. In this software, I used KNN principles as a mathematical basis (Euclidean relation :)). I hope you like the machine learning software. Knowledge is good when shared!

The values you enter should be (respectively):

**1) You need to enter data in the 'buying' section.**

**2) You need to enter data in the 'maint' section.**

**3) You need to enter data in the 'doors' section.**

**4) You need to enter data in the 'lug-boot' section.**

**5) You need to enter data in the 'safety' section.**

_Prediction Example:_ `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = model_selection.train_test_split(X_n,y_n,test_size = 0.3)`

_Prediction Outpot :_ `Prediction Class:  [2]`

_Accuracy Example:_ `accuracy = neighbors_clf.score(X_test,y_test)`

 Prediction Outpot :_ `Accuracy of the:  0.9248554913294798`
**I am happy to present this software to you!**
